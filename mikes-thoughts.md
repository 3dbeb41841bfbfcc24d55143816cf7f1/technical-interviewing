## Anatomy of a Technical Interview

Technical Interviews have many forms.
Some common ingredients that you may see:

* A written test
* A personality test
* A phone screen
    - Covers basic resume items such as work history, skills, relevant
      experience
    - Goal is to see if candidate is worth bringing on site for a half day to
      a full day of face to face interviews
    - Similar to a “it’s just lunch” date - i.e. there is a low level of
      investment on both sides
    - Candidates are rejected for a range of reasons
* A half day to a full day of face to face interviews
    - Could be 1-on-1 or many-on-1
    - General questions:
        * What kind of work are you looking for?
        * What are you passionate about?
        * Where do you want to be in a year or two?
        * What will make you happy?
    - Experience questions:
        * Interviewers want to know what you have done
        * Specifically what was the *contribution* that *you* made to a
          project
        * It isn’t enough to say “I worked on this great project.”
        * You have to be able to explain the project, its significance, and
          your contribution to the project.
            - What was the business need for the project?
            - How did the project solve the problem / satisfy the need?
            - What alternatives were considered?
            - What was the general architecture of the project?
            - What was the technology stack?
            - What parts of the system did you work on?
            - What challenges did you encounter?
            - How did you solve those challenges?
            - What did you learn from working on the project?
            - What would you do different?
    - Technical questions:
        * Based on your resume
        * Don’t put something on your resume unless you are prepared to talk
          about it!!!
        * Basic problem solving and programming problems
        * Expect to write on a white board
        * Puzzlers are now out-of-fashion
        * Good problem solving is always in fashion

## Preparing for a Technical Interview

* If you are working with a Recruiter, they will usually help you with
  general expectations and preparation.
* Research the company:
    - What do they do?
    - How long have they been in existence?
    - What are their current initiatives?
    - Where are they going as a company?
* Be able to talk about everything on your resume
    - You never know what items on your resume they will ask you about
* Prepare for the technical parts of the interview:
    - Review technical concepts
    - Be able to answer questions such as:
        * What is OOP?
        * What is Ruby?
        * What is MVC?
            - Why is it important?
        * What is AR?
        * What is REST?
        * What is CRUD?
        * What are the common HTTP methods?
        * What is TDD and BDD?
        * How do you use Git to see your commit history?
        * How do you join 2 tables in SQL?
        * What is the difference between an Inner Join and an Outer Join?
    - Do programming Katas
        * see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata#Outside_of_martial_arts
    - Be prepared to write code *ON A WHITEBOARD*!
        * First make sure you understand the problem
        * If you are not sure, ask questions. This will not be counted against you (unless your questions indicate a fundamental lack of knowledge about a concept that you should know)
        * Second, if its a programming problem, list some valid inputs and the expected outputs:
            - for leap_year method we would have:
                1900 => false
                2000 => true
                2001 => false
                2004 => true
        * Begin writing the code or if needed write pseudo-code or draw a diagram
        * Don’t prematurely optimize your code - make your code clear, concise, and correct
        * If you get stuck, feel free to discuss your thoughts or ask questions
        * When you finish writing the code, check that the code returns the expected outputs from above
        * Announce when you are done and if requested, walk through your solution
        * Be prepared to discuss alternative solutions and optimizations
            - optimizations come at the end
    - Prepare questions to ask them:
        * What projects / initiatives are you working on?
        * Do you use Agile / Scrum practices?
        * What do your Sprints look like?
        * What does a dev team look like at your company?
        * What kind of testing do you do?
        * Do you have flex hours?
        * Do you have a work from home policy?
        * Note: be careful with asking too many questions that may imply that you are lazy or don’t want to come to work

## Passing the Technical Interview

1. Be confident *and* humble:

You should know what you know and know when you don't know.

The primary goal of a technical interview is to assess you, the candidate, as
an intelligent and capable problem solver. Your existing knowledge is generally
*NOT* the deciding factor. That said, a simple *"I don't know (…yet!)"* is
almost always the correct answer for your areas of inexperience. Interviewers
respect this self-recognition of what you don't know, and where you'd like to
improve.

The worst thing you can do is try to *fake* an answer. The interviewer will
probably know that you are *faking* it and they will not be impressed.

2. Why are you here?

The interviewer may ask "What made you want to interview with us?"

Interviewing is a lot like dating. Be ready to explain WHY you identify with
a prospective employer, and why you'd be interested (or excited!) to work with
them. They want you to be *excited* about the opportunity.

3. Be cautiously optimistic

Show excitement but don't appear desperate!


## When to Negotiate

* Generally you don’t discuss or negotiate the salary and benefits until they make an offer or ask you for your salary requirements.
* Do your research regarding salary:
    - What do companies typically pay for this job in your area (Atlanta, Southeast)
* Consider your work experience
* Consider the type of company
    - Startups generally pay a little less than more established companies
* Always ask for a little more than your minimum
    - Give them some room for negotiation
    - Show that you can negotiate / you are flexible
* Know what is important to you:
    - Is salary more important than flex hours?
    - Is working for an exciting startup more important than job stability or a matching 401K?
* Do you care about stock options, stock grants, 401K, generous vacation, working from home, flex hours, etc.

## Contract vs. Perm

* It may help to develop a formula for comparing W2 salaries to
  contract / hourly rates:
    - There are roughly 2000 hours in a work year
    - So a $60,000 a year salary would be about $30 per hour
    - BUT contractors don’t get:
        * paid vacation
        * stock options
        * 401K benefits
        * medical insurance benefits
        * 1/2 of their FICA taxes paid for them (that is a 7.5% benefit)
        * long term security
    - Conversely Permanent / W2 employees don’t get:
        * paid for overtime
    - Short term contracts generally pay _higher_ than long term contracts
        * Long term: lock in a rate and guarantee employment for a longer period of time
    - Generally the contract rate should be about 30% to 50% higher than the permanent rate
        * contract_rate = perm_salary / 2000 * 1.4
        * contract_rate = $60,000 / 2000 * 1.4 = $42 / hour

## Recruiters:

* Recruiters are like Real Estate Agents
    - Do you trust them?
* They take a cut / commission:
    - Can be 10% to 20% for contractors - they mark you up by 10% to 20%
    - They charge a flat rate for permanent - often charging the company a one time fee of 10% to 20% of your salary
* Contract-to-perm
    - With contract-to-hire, the company has the right to offer you a permanent position after a period of contracting.
    - If a recruiter is involved, they pay the recruiter a fee when you convert.
